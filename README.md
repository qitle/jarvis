Automation Using Applescript by Aashay Shah <aashay0101@gmail.com>

You can use OSX "Speech Feedback" feature to talk with your Mac
and get things done by just saying the command.
To do this you just need to copy scripts from this repo to "Speakable Items" folder.
When you say name of the script it will execute in the background and do what it is supposed to.

You can google around for how to set up "Speech Feedback" and how to set it to Lisetening Mode.
Another cool thing you can do is to install "CronniX" and set scripts to execute on specific time or on intervals.
More on this Later...
